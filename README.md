# **Australia Address Parser**

Australia Address Parser is a regex-based street address and street intersection parser for AustraliağŸ‡¦ğŸ‡º. It's basic goal is  parsing user-provided address strings into parts, thus identify the street type (that Google API is not providing). 

## Project Version Status
v1.0.1

This project is a fork of https://github.com/pay-k/australia-address-parser and https://github.com/gordonlkc/autralia-address-parser, I converted it into typescript and fixed a bug in unit address matching.

Please refer to src/parser.test.ts for usage.
